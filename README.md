# Dictionary
Easy access to the built-in dictionary in iOS
***
This app simply displays a text field, allowing you to search your iPhone's local (offline) dictionary as accessed by the "Look Up" action on selected text. It also employs `DispatchQueue`s to ensure buttery smooth operation.

Unfortunately, Apple would never allow this app into the App Storeâ€”["[UIReferenceLibraryViewController] should not be used to display wordlists, create a standalone dictionary app, or republish the content in any form."](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uireferencelibraryviewcontroller)
